# ☕ Coffee Tracker – Interactive Cup Counter
A lightweight and fun desktop app built with **Python + Tkinter** that tracks the number of coffee cups consumed.  
The counter updates visually as the number increases, giving it a playful and engaging vibe.  
To encourage moderation, the coffee cup expressions change when the consumption exceeds a certain limit, 
making it a fun way to track and control your caffeine intake.
